# WVU Undergraduate Work

This work is here to document my progress as I continue working towards my bachelor's degree in  computer science. 

**If you are a current WVU Student:**

Do not copy my work. If you wish to use it as a reference when you are stuck, that is one thing. However, if you blatantly 
copy my code, don't expect to not get caught. You are only cheating yourself. With that said, don't even think about forking this repo.
